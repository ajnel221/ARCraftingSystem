# The System Works As Follows:
  1. Pick you 3 cards, each representing a crafting material.
  2. Once you have selected your cards, scan them with the app, one by one. As the image gets recognised, it will spawn a 3D object ontop of that card that represents its crafting material.
  3. If you have selected 3 cards that are part of a crafting recipe, it will display what the output would be, the crafted item.
 
# The Crafting Recipes Are The Following:
 1. Iron Ingot + Gold Ingot + Black Ingot = Templar Helmet
 2. Red Ingot + Green Ingot + Blue Ingot = Shield
 3. Iron Ingot + Gold Ingot + Red Ingot = Sword
 
 # The Following Cards Represent These Carfting Materials:
 1. Death = Iron Ingot
 2. Devil = Gold Ingot
 3. 4 Swords = Black Ingot
 4. Ace of Swords = Blue Ingot
 5. Ace of Coins = Green Ingot
 6. Page of Swords = Red Ingot
